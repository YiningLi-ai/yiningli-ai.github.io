I am an incoming master student at [Tsinghua University](https://www.zhihu.com/people/zhui-long-78-73), and I received my bachelor's degree in the honors mathematics program at [Xi'an Jiaotong University](https://www.xjtu.edu.cn/). My research interests lie in computer vision and foundational model improvements. I also spent one semester at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) as an exchange student.
